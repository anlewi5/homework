## super_fizz:

In this assignment you’ll implement an algorithm that is actually used in some programmer interviews. And the really shocking part is that some people fail it! This is an extension of the FizzBuzz problem. Write an implementation of the following algorithm.

Iterate through the numbers 0 through 1000 and for each one print out exactly one thing. These rules are in descending priority:

Run the file, using the command:

ruby super_fizz.rb

* If it’s evenly divisible by 3, 5, and 7 print SuperFizzBuzz
* If it’s evenly divisible by 3 and 7 print SuperFizz
* If it’s evenly divisible by 5 and 7 print SuperBuzz
* If it’s evenly divisible by 3 and 5 print FizzBuzz
* If it’s evenly divisible by 3, print Fizz
* If it’s evenly divisible by 5, print Buzz
* If it’s evenly divisible by 7, print Super
* Otherwise print just the number
